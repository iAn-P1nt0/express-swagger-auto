# express-swagger-auto Roadmap

This document outlines the vision and planned phases for express-swagger-auto. Our goal is to make OpenAPI spec generation from Express apps as effortless and comprehensive as possible.

- [ ] APM integrations (New Relic, DataDog)

### Phase 10: AI-Assisted Features (Q3 2025)
**Focus**: Intelligent automation

**Planned Features:**
- [ ] AI description generation from code
- [ ] Security recommendation engine
- [ ] API design suggestions based on patterns
- [ ] Automatic error response documentation
- [ ] Smart example generation
- [ ] API compatibility checking

## Public API Stability

### Current (v0.1.x)
- Core API is **UNSTABLE** - breaking changes possible
- CLI is relatively stable but may have command changes
- Expect breaking changes between minor versions

### Planned (v1.0.0)
- Core API becomes **STABLE** - semantic versioning enforced
- No breaking changes without major version bump
- 12-month deprecation notice for removed features
- Backwards compatibility guides for upgrades

## Community Milestones

| Milestone | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| GitHub Stars | 100 | Pending release |
| npm Weekly Downloads | 500 | Pending release |
